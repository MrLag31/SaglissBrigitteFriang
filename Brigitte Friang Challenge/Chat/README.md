# Chat

Moving on the next part on https://challengecybersec.fr/chat which is some kind of messaging web app. The first person we encounter is Armand Richelieu saying that we are in a mission about 'Evil Country' and that we are an agent named 42. 4 other people contact us by giving challenges in different categories:

- __[Crypto](./Crypto)__: Antoine Rossignol
- __[Web](./Web)__: Jérémy Nitel
- __[Algo](./Algo)__: Blaise Pascal
- __[Forensic (WIP)](./Forensic)__: Alphonse Bertillon

We tackled all of the four challenges, with various degree of success. We were able to get through this part using the Web way.
